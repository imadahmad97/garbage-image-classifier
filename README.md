# Garbage Bin Sorter - Overview
Garbage bin sorter is a image classification model for images of waste. It sorts the images into one of:

 1. Trash
 2. Compost
 3. Recycling

We have implemented this model in a variety of ways, including a web application and even a trash sorting robot!

# Model
The image classification model is a convolutional neural network built with Keras. It consists of an input layer, 9 convolutional 2D layers, 4 Max Pooling 2D layers, 1 flatten layer, and 3 Dense layers. The model was trained on data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification?select=garbage_classification).
